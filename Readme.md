# Cloud Microservices Application

This project demonstrates a cloud-native microservices architecture deployed using Docker and Kubernetes. The system includes multiple services communicating via REST and gRPC, and uses asynchronous messaging, monitoring, and container orchestration.

## 🧩 Project Architecture

- **Client** – Frontend to view student and course data.
- **ServerA** – Manages student information (runs on port `5000`).
- **ServerB** – Manages course information (runs on port `5001`).
- **Grpc** – Fetches data from ServerA and ServerB, returns analytics.
- **APIGateway** – Routes external requests to microservices (runs on port `8080`).
- **RabbitMQ** – Message broker for asynchronous data communication.
- **Seq** – Centralized logging.
- **Prometheus** – Health and uptime monitoring.

All services are containerized and run in a bridge network for local development and as Kubernetes pods in production.

## 🚀 Features

- MVC structure with separate Client, API Gateway, and Servers
- Asynchronous event-driven communication using RabbitMQ
- gRPC integration for combined analytics
- Centralized logging with Seq
- Health monitoring using Prometheus
- Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes manifests for production deployment

## 📦 Getting Started

### Run with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access Services
- Client: `http://localhost:<client-port>`
- APIGateway: `http://localhost:8080`
- RabbitMQ: `http://localhost:15672`
- Seq: `http://localhost:5341`
- Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

1. Convert `docker-compose.yml` to Kubernetes YAML using Kompose:
```bash
kompose convert
```

2. Apply the files to your Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
kubectl apply -f .
```

3. Monitor namespace and pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n lab-namespace
```
